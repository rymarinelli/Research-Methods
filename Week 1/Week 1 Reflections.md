#Consider what research is and why it is relevant to computer science. 
#Think about your own personal understanding of research and note down your own definition of it.

Research is a process that adheres to the scientific method. You essentially form a hunch and create a hypothesis and create an experiment. 
You then collect data for this experiement and create a model. You then intrepret the results of the model/ experiment and communicate 
it out in a fashion that allows the results to be reproduced.
