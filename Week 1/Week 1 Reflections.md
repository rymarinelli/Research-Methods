<h3> Question 1 </h3>
<br>Consider what research is and why it is relevant to computer science. </br>
<br>Think about your own personal understanding of research and note down your own definition of it.</br>

```
Research is a process that adheres to the scientific method. You essentially form a hunch and create a hypothesis and create an experiment. 
You then collect data for this experiement and create a model. You then intrepret the results of the model/ experiment and communicate 
it out in a fashion that allows the results to be reproduced.

<h3>Describe the difference based on the continuum of formal and informal sources of research ideas.</h3>

```
I think the main difference is how the research question is formed and how specific the question is when posed. 
Less formal questions may focus on description. More formal question may focus on causal realtionships or a more targeted problem
